This repository contains a console program focused on working with information extracted from a municipal government data feed containing bids submitted for the auction of properties. The assignment involves exploring sorting algorithms by implementing a Hash Table of bids loaded from CSV files.

Data Sets

eBid_Monthly_Sales.csv: Larger set of 12,023 bids.
eBid_Monthly_Sales_Dec_2016.csv: Smaller set of 76 bids.

Display All Bids: Display all loaded bids.
Find Bid
Remove Bid
Exit
